Notes:
This is submission for 'Interview Demo 2_Daily Fantasy'. ie. Second Test.
As this only a CSS/SCSS test, I haven't added proper JS functionality. I have hardcoded data in HTML. If I have to make a real App then I can make this using Handlebars if done by JS otherwise we can use React or Vue.js to make this App.
In order to show both views I have added JS click functionality for the 'List' & 'Pitch' toggle buttons and 'Continue' button. The 'Pitch' shows the current team.
I haven't added all 22 playes in the player list as this is just a CSS/SCSS test. Only added 6 players.
As the styles are only provided for Mobile view, this will work only till 768px width. Minimum supported resolution is 320px.
